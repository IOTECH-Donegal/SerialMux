## SerialMux
- Created this as a Kplex replacement.
- Working, tested on Raspbian Buster, vanilla.
- This version setup to take a GPS on one serial port and the Magnetometer on the other.

## SerialMux2
- Cut down and simplified!
- Stable, use this version only!!
- This version takes up to 2 serial inputs, logs them, sends them to a UDP_IP:Port

## SerialMuxGUI
- Works on Windows, hangs on Ubuntu, not ready for use!
